## 💭 Personal Reflection

### Bridging Theory and Practice
This industry talk provided my first exposure to enterprise-level technology implementation at a global scale. Seeing how **PPG integrates data analytics, SAP systems, and cloud infrastructure** across 70 countries transformed abstract academic concepts into tangible business applications.

### Key Revelations:
1. **Scale Matters:** Real industry data operates at terabytes-scale with complex dependencies
2. **Integration is Everything:** Technologies don't work in isolation—they form interconnected ecosystems
3. **Business Alignment:** Every technical decision directly impacts business outcomes and global operations

### Skills Gap Identified:
- Academic projects use clean, structured data → Industry handles messy, real-time global data
- Classroom tools are simplified → Enterprise requires distributed systems and multi-cloud platforms
- Individual assignments → Cross-functional team collaboration across time zones

### Career Impact:
This session clarified my interest in **enterprise IT architecture** and **data system integration**. It highlighted the importance of developing **T-shaped skills**—deep technical expertise combined with broad business understanding and collaboration abilities.

### Moving Forward:
- Pursue hands-on experience with cloud platforms (Azure, AWS)
- Develop proficiency in data pipeline construction
- Seek internships focusing on business-technology integration
- Contribute to projects that bridge academic learning with industry applications

*The most valuable insight: Technology's ultimate purpose is enabling people across the world to work together effectively.*
