📊 Industry Talk: Data Analytics, Infrastructure & SAP

On 20/11/2025, I had the opportunity to attend an industry talk by PPG Malaysia Technology Center (MYTC) and gain insights into how data analytics, IT infrastructure, and SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing) support global business operations 🌍.

💡 Learned how SAP S/4HANA, cloud platforms, and the Plan Build Run model enable efficiency, scalability, and data-driven decision-making.

📝 To reinforce our learning, we also prepared a detailed poster summarizing the concepts, technologies, and real-world applications discussed during the session.

✨ Key takeaway: Successful digital transformation depends on the strong integration of analytics, cloud technologies, and enterprise systems.
